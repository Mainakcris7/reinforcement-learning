# Selection of best advertisement 

This project is to develop `reinforcement learning` based model, which can select the best advertisement from a bunch of advertisement, so that, the marketing revenue will be highest.

**Note** : *In real life, the model selects the best advertisement at any particular moment, which will lead to highest revenue, without being **pre-trained**. In this project, I tried to resemble the online deplyment through a dataset.*
